# ðŸš€ Stress Testing for C++ in Linux

This repository provides a **stress testing** approach for C++ programs using **Bash scripting** in a Linux environment. The goal is to find test cases where an optimized solution produces incorrect results by comparing its output against a brute-force (correct) solution.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. The directory contains:
   - **`correct.cpp`** â€“ A brute-force or verified correct solution.
   - **`wrong.cpp`** â€“ An optimized solution that might fail on some test cases.
   - **`generator.cpp`** â€“ A random test case generator that follows problem constraints.

2. The script generates random inputs and tests both solutions against them.

3. If both programs produce the same output, the script continues testing. If a discrepancy is found, the process stops, and the failing test case is saved.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Ensure all three files (`correct.cpp`, `wrong.cpp`, `generator.cpp`) are set up for the same problem.**
2. **Run the stress test script:**
   ```bash
   bash test.sh
